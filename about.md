# About Me

### Hi.

I'm not sure how you got here, but there's nothing to see for now. Eventually, the fruits of my endeavors to teach myself various coding and programming languages for **gestures broadly** *reasons* will be posted here.

If you're a potential employer, ooohs and aaahs are appreciated. Also, emojis. Kaomojis too, if you're familiar with them.
